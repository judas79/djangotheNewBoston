Django comes with sqlite3 installed and in the setup.py file.  But it needs to be configured to
connect to our code.

Django comes with many apps already installed in the setting.py, many of which will need setup with the database:
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    ]

This line, from the Powershell runserver command, means that the apps, source code and the database are not in sync.
'You have 17 un-applied migration(s). Your project may not work properly until you apply the migrations for app(s):
admin, auth, contenttypes, sessions.'
Typing 'python manage.py migrate' in powershell or cmd propmpt will sync the code and apps with the database.
It syncs them by going into the settings.py and looking for installed apps.  Within each app it looks through the apps
directory for what tables are needed to work that particular app.  Each app has its own requirements as far as tables go.
If your run:
'python manage.py migrate'
the message of needing to migrate will no longer be there.

Based in our discussion at school, the migrations just detect changes in the models.py per "app"



why haven't u installed music app?

He hasnt written anything inside it yet...
Because, you need to define what tables you are going to need for database and etc. Once he defines tables properly,
he will make migration. That's why he probably didn't installed music app yet.
