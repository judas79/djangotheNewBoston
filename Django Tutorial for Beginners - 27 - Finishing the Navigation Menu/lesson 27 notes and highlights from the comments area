We will finish making our navigation toolbar. To hide all the items and buttons within the navigation bar, we will add
the id to the top of the items area 'class' in our index.html code.  This will be handled by 'bootstrap'.  The id will
be equal to whatever the topNavBar is:
        <div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="topNavBar">

Next we will build the search box form, even though not function as of yet; use navbar for all forms, you create:
    <form class="navbar-form navbar-left" role='search' method='get' action='#'>
Then we us form-group for styling:
        <div class="form-group">
The input area, is where the user types the query, the variable q stores the query search terms the user entered.  The
value will be set in a later lesson.
            <input type="text"class="form-control" name="q" value="">
Then we create the submit button for the search box with default colors then close out all the html tags use in
this area of the code:
        </div>
        <button type="submit" class="btn btn-default">Search</button>
    </form>

Next we will make buttons for the 'navbar-right side of the navigation area, copying many portions from the left side;
we just finished completing:
        <ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right">
                        <li class="">
                            <!-- associated link item to  -->
                            <a href="#">
The first left hand button; uses plus-glyph for the icon within 'Add Album'
                                <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus" aria-hidden="true"></span>&nbsp; AddAlbum
                             </a>
                        </li>
Copied from above we added the last button, on the far right of the window.  This button is for logging out and uses
glyphicon-off for the logout icon:
                        <li class="">
                    <!-- associated link item to  -->
                    <a href="#">
                        <!-- off glyph icon (log off), within 'Logout' -->
                        <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-off" aria-hidden="true"></span>&nbsp; Logout
                    </a>
                </li

To change the corners of the navigation tools box, from rounded, which is the bootstrap default setting, to a square
corner, tweak to the style, we will add to style.css:
.navbar{
    border-radius: 0;
}

To over ride Bootstraps' default settings, you must list it at the top of all the CDNs, so you can use the other CDNs
after bootstrap is loaded, to tweak items.  Other added CDNs may also have to be entered in a way that the defaults of
one should be before the one you are replacing it with.  We will now use the 'font' CDN, we have in our style.css page,
to switch to a fancy cursive font.  'Satisfy' is in the font link we downloaded and cursive is a backup method:
.navbar-brand{
    font-family: 'Satisfy', cursive
}

Clear your cache data and images in your browser to see the updated fonts and corners, you made.

my 'Satisfy' google font is not working at all...

I tested on IE browser and it works there, but not on Google Chrome. Interesting...

Exactly, my font too is not working on chrome but works fine on explorer.

How can I make this work on chrome as well ?

how to make it work on chrome, btw working on edge

Works in Firefox as well, but not chrome
[edited] In the google chrome drop down click 'more tools', 'clear browsing data', check the box 'cached images
and data', then click 'clear data' and reload your music page, and you should see your font changes, as well as the
non-rounded corners.





my navbar toggle button is not showing anything on clicking it can anybody help?

Make sure the order of jquery and bootstrap file is same while importing or check for any typo. Jquery should come
first then bootstrap.





If anyone still has the problem with the right button - I had the same problem and it was actually there but invisible.
So instead of these three lines
 <span class="icon-bar"></span>
I made
<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-menu-down"></span>
It looks different but it works :)





If you have an extra space on top of the page you might have done 2 mistakes: do not copy heading text
( about importing css) from comments. Just retype it by yourself. If it doesn't work, you might have CSS file saves ad
UTF-8 with BOM. Save it with classic UTD-8 (Notepad++ or Sublime will help you).




cannot collapse item in navbar

what I did was just add the id on this line:
<!-- Items -->
        <div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="topNavBar">




once i click on the button my items not appear.
my button line looks exactly like yours and also my lcass: collapse navbar-collapse have id=topNavBar
what i did wrong?

I had the same problem. Solution is:
1. You need to change script links postion with jquery and js.
2. The first must be jquery script link and the next bootstrap js link.
Right that:
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.2.0/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.6/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>





For those who are facing trouble with css file update:
1) Delete the browser cache file
2) Add STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static') at the bottom of your settings.py code(below STATIC_URL)
Happy coding!





If anyone was running into trouble that the new css was not working. I figured out that google was caching my old css
file so when I updated it, it would not show. so to check open the private window and go to your url.
