In lesson 3, in the root directory of the project, where manage.py is, with the command
'python manage.py startapp <app name here>
we created a package directory named Django_Tutorial_for_Beginners_3_Creating_Our_First_App_music,
which was later renamed:  'music'.
We also learned how to stop the server by pushing keyboard buttons 'cmd c' and then clear it by typing 'clear'
and pressing the 'enter' button.
Leave the server running in one PowerShell window and launch another one to work in.
All the different sections of a website that can be explained within one sentence is considered an app.  For example a
music portion, video portion, or a forum.  If it takes more than one sentence to explain, it should be further divided
more package directories.
