We will be learning how to make a REST API in this lesson.  A REST API is a way of making it possible for all sorts of
different apps and platforms to access a website.  The alternative would be to write software to handle the sites API to
speak to all the different nodes types, one at a time.  For instance there would be software to handle communication
between Iphone and the site or android and the site and all the other different platforms that could need to communicate
with the sites API.  The data format we will use with the REST API is named JSON and it is not affiliated with any
particular device.  It is a format to communicate between devices and the API, and can be used to make apps for those
devices.  It is one of the first things that should be implemented into a startup website.
First we need to install REST using pip, from our home directory in Pycharm.

pip install djangorestframework

OUTPUT:

Successfully installed asgiref-3.2.7 django-3.0.5 djangorestframework-3.11.0 pytz-201
9.3 sqlparse-0.3.1

We will create a website that stores stock information, and will tell you the updated stock prices, when you connect to
it, and later on we can add the functionality of an iphone, and android apps.  We will start with entering the following
into our cmd window.

python manage.py startapp companies

It doesn't seem to do anything, but also don't get any errors.

Then we will switch over to our settings.py and configure some things.  In the 'INSTALLED_APPS - [ ' area we need to add
at the bottom, what we installed with pip:

'rest_framework',

We also need to add the app name (directory) we created, with the startapp:

'companies.apps.CompaniesConfig',

Now django knows we are using the rest_framework and have created an app named companies.
So next we will go to the models.py in the companies app directory and create a class named Stock, for out stock data.
We will inherit from import, models, which was generated when the companies app was created.

class Stock(models.Model):

Why are you adding 'companies.apps.CompaniesConfig' to INSTALLED_APPS, wouldn't just 'companies' do the trick?


If you look at the docs for Django Rest Framework, it tells you to do this. A Rest Framework is different than a
"normal" django project. . . http://www.django-rest-framework.org/tutorial/1-serialization/


I think this is new way of adding installed apps for django 1.9
If you use django <1.9 you can just use app name






I had an issue where I called my new app 'rest_api' and I put 'rest_api.apps.Rest_apiConfig' in to the installed apps
list and it kept coming up with an error saying ' No module named 'rest_api.apps.rest_apiconfig'; 'rest_api.apps' is not
a package'. no matter how I changed the casing on the name, it still didn't work.

I just figured it out though, made a new app without the underscore and it works fine now, so no underscores in your app
name.






I have installed djangorestframework and upgraded to the latest version as well. I have tried this using both pip and
pip3 and yet I keep getting the following error
 "ImportError: No module named 'rest_framework'" when I run the make migrations command.
Any idea how to resolve it?

Thanks

Add rest_framework in ur installed_apps of settings.py


Check the Django version


REST framework requires the following:

Python (2.7, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6)
Django (1.10, 1.11, 2.0 alpha)
http://www.django-rest-framework.org/


I think you did pip install rest_framework instead of pip install djangorestframework

It's pip install djangorestframework,
but you've gotta add 'rest_framework' to settings.py INSTALLED_APPS
