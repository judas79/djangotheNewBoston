In lesson 3 we created a new app named Django_Tutorial_for_Beginners_3_Creating_Our_First_App_music.  All the different
sections of a website that can be explained within one sentence is considered an app.  For example a music portion, video
portion or a forum.

In lesson 4 the files that where created using 'python manage.py startapp Django_Tutorial_for_Beginners_3_Creating_Our_First_App_music',
are explained.
