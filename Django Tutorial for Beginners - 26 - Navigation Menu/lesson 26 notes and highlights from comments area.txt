In this lesson we will be adding everything on the toolbar, even things not yet created.  We will use empty links,
for making the design, of these non functional tools, and link them to the proper sections, later.

First we will add external files to our index.py, used for the design aspects, that will be applied to
our toolbar.
This library file source is a font from Google:
<link href="//fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Satisfy" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">

This library file source is for jquery; v 1.12.0 was used in this lesson, and this is the updated version:
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.4.1/jquery.min.js"></script>

This library file source is for javascript for bootstrap; v 3.3.6 was used in this lesson and this is the updated version:
<script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.4.1/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>

Javascript for bootstrap, is being included for its functionality.  It will enable the toolbar to resize accordingly to
the web pages, when they are re-sized.  It will create a small icon dropdown, containing the toolbar objects.

We will change the navbar in index.html to be dark instead of light.  In index.html we change:
<nav class='navbar navbar-default'> # light
to
<nav class='navbar navbar-inverse'> # black

We will also use the javascript bootstrap, to add the object, that appears when the screen size of the web page is
re-sized, too small to display, all the tools, in the toolbar. This will  add the button dropdown button containing
the tools:
        <button type="button" class="navbar-toggle" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#topNavBar">
The bootstrap library source, has many 'class' methods included, that will handle most desired functionality, built in.
data-toggle="collapse" is what this class does.  All the objects in the toolbar are now wrapped in the container named
"#topNavBar".  This makes the objects, toggle, visible or invisible with the dropdown button, to see them.

The 'hamburger' looking, settings icon, with the three small horizontal lines, that is used for 'settings', has to be
created manually, when using bootstrap:
                <span class="icon-bar"></span>
                <span class="icon-bar"></span>
                <span class="icon-bar"></span>

Next we will create the other items in the toolbar within a <div>.
First we make the section of the navigational container collapsible, so the items within it will appear and disappear
when the window is re-sized:
<div class="collapse navbar-collapse">

Then to make buttons we us a numbered unordered list with class navbarnav:
                <ul class="nav navbar-nav">

The list items will have a link associated with them, but for now not function.  We will add our first list item;
'Album':
                     <a href="{% url 'music:index' %}">

Within the Album item, we will have a small glyth icon; &nbsp; adds space between this item and the next one and add the
text Albums:  Glyphicons are glyph icons, in this circumstance supplied by bootstrap for use in its class=.  ARIA is
shorthand for Accessible Rich Internet Applications. ARIA is a set of attributes you can add HTML elements.
                           <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-cd" aria-hidden="true"></span>&nbsp; Albums

Next we will copy and paste the list; <li>, and <a> blocks within it, and change the name to 'Songs' and glyth icon to
glyphicon-music, to complete the 'Music' item:
 <li class="">
    <!-- associated link item to 'Songs' -->
    <a href="#">
        <!-- music glyph icon within 'Songs' -->
        <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-music" aria-hidden="true"></span>&nbsp; Songs
    </a>
 </li>

 If we change the
 <li class=''
 to
<li class='active'
you will notice the item become highlighted.  This will be used in the future and the Albums or Songs item depending on
which page you have selected.




************** highlights from the comments area ****************



if someone is trying to use the navbar-inverse then it willnot work as it is for version 3 ;
for version 4 please check the official documentation  -
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/navbar/#color-schemes




If anyone is using bootstrap 4, be aware that they dropped support for glyphicons. Use fontawesome instead.
