These are my notes and files from theNewBoston Django tutorial by Bucky Roberts.  There are also some tips added by me,
for example, a quick way to runserver in the Tutorial 1 folder.  Some lessons take place in sub folders and they will be
like that in this repo., as well.

Dig in the djangotheNewBoston/djangotheNewBoston/ sub directory if you cannot find the lesson in the main directory
(djangotheNewBoston).

On all the files, in the lessons.  I will be using the letter 'L' for lesson and the number after it will be the lesson
number that the portion of code was derived from.  L5 for example would be from Lesson 5.

Share these files freely, for this is just all meant to be an exercise in using: Django, PyCharm, and git within PyCharm pro, to access
and organise my learning on git-hub.
