These are my notes and files from theNewBoston Django tutorial by Bucky Roberts.  There are also some tips added by me, for example,
a quick way to runserver in the Tutorial 1 folder.  Some lessons take place in sub folders and they will be like that in this repo.,
as well.  Dig in the djangotheNewBoston/djangotheNewBoston/ sub directory if you cannot find the lesson in the main directory (djangotheNewBoston).

Share these files freely, for this is just all meant to be an exercise in using: Django, PyCharm, and git within PyCharm pro, to access
and organise my learning on git-hub.
